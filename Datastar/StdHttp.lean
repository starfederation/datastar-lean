/-!
SSE streaming on `Std.Http`, and the signals a request carries.

The browser sends its signals as JSON: in the `datastar` query parameter for GET and DELETE, in
the request body otherwise. `signalsText` returns that JSON as text, for any JSON library to
read; `Datastar.LeanJson` decodes it with `Lean.Data.Json`.

namespace Datastar

/--
An opaque handle for sending SSE events to the browser.

Obtain one from the callback passed to `sseResponse`.

The handle is safe to share between tasks.
